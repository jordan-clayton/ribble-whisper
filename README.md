# Whisper Realtime

A rust-based, realtime capable, wrapper library for [whisper-rs](https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs).
Seeks to provide an ergonomic API to support realtime and static speech transcription applications.

Realtime transcription (most likely) requires GPU support. CPU testing in release mode
has not yet been tested.

See: Cargo.toml for feature flags to compile with GPU support (proper documentation coming)

- See examples for use.

## TODO:

- Cleanup realtime transcriber
- Finish readme
- Proper documentation
