# Whisper Realtime

A rust-based, realtime-capable, wrapper library for [whisper-rs](https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs).
Seeks to provide an ergonomic API to support realtime and static speech transcription applications.

At this time, accurate realtime transcription (and use of larger models) requires GPU acceleration.
Offline transcription is possible with larger models via the CPU.

See: Cargo.toml for feature flags to compile with GPU support

- See examples for usage

### Note: This is not production-ready and the API may change at any time during development.

### Full documentation is coming (hopefully) soon to accompany a somewhat stable API.

## TODO:

- Finish README
- Documentation
